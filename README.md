I am deligted to present my mern stack based chat application. I have used jwt-based authentication as well as user signup facilities, zustand for global state management and axios api for connecting with the backend. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas and the website is hosted on this site:

I have used socket.io for real time communication.
